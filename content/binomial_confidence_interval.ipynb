You can tune how conservative or optimistic this estimate for the real single trial success probability should be by setting the ```confidence level```. If you set the confidence level to ```0.95```, the real single trial success probability will lie within the interval calculated at least in ```95%``` of these evaluations. That means there still is at most a ```5%``` chance that the real single trial success probability will be worse than the estimated interval suggests.\n\nNote: all probabilities are given as numbers between 0 and 1, where 0 represents \"never\" and 1 represents 100% certainty.",
